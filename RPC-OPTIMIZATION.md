# RPC Connection Optimization

This document describes the optimizations implemented for RPC connections in our Solana trading system.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Connection Prioritization

We've implemented a strict hierarchy for RPC connections to ensure optimal performance:

1. **Instant Nodes** - Primary provider with premium performance and reliability
2. **Helius** - Secondary provider for fallback operations
3. **Alchemy** - Tertiary provider when needed
4. **Public endpoints** - Last resort when all premium endpoints are unavailable

### 2. Advanced Rate Limiting

Our rate limiting system respects provider-specific limits and prevents 429 errors:

- **Instant Nodes**: Limited to ~93 requests/minute based on 4M monthly limit
- Implemented provider-specific rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
- Request prioritization (CRITICAL, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW, BATCH)

### 3. Optimized Program Account Fetching

We've implemented special handling for large programs to avoid overloading RPC providers:

- **Serum DEX**: Required specific memcmp filters as mandated by Instant Nodes
- **Token Program**: Data slicing to limit response size  
- **Raydium**: Special handling due to extremely large account set
- Custom error recovery for "response too big" and "requires filters" errors

### 4. Health Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive health monitoring:

- Connection health checks with automatic failover
- Endpoint latency tracking and response time optimization
- Periodic full health checks (every 5 minutes)
- Performance statistics logging (every 15 minutes)

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling

We've implemented robust error handling specifically for RPC connections:

- Automatic retries with different endpoints
- Intelligent connection switching based on error type
- Specialized handling for rate limit errors
- Detailed error logging for monitoring and debugging

## Environment Configuration

The system handles environment variables flexibly:

- Supports both `VARIABLE_NAME` and `VITE_VARIABLE_NAME` formats
- Automatically constructs proper URLs from token-only configurations
- Loads RPC endpoints in priority order
- Maintains multiple connections with failover capabilities

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further optimization:

1. Implement request batching for non-critical operations
2. Add more sophisticated caching for frequently requested data
3. Develop more specific filters for large programs like Raydium
4. Implement request throttling based on wallet activity patterns
