# Solana Quantum Trading System

A comprehensive Solana trading system with custom transformers, AI trading agents, and a transaction engine to identify opportunities and execute trades on the blockchain.

## Core Features

- **Quantum-Inspired Algorithms**: Enhanced trading signal detection using quantum-inspired processing techniques
- **Custom Transformers**: Market data and trading signal transformers for sophisticated data analysis
- **AI Trading Agents**: Autonomous agents that evaluate opportunities and execute trades
- **Solana Blockchain Integration**: Direct interaction with Solana for fast, efficient transactions
- **Secure Wallet Management**: Comprehensive wallet controls and transaction history

## Architecture

The system is built with a layered architecture:

- **Engine Layer (Innermost)**: Transaction Engine for executing strategies and managing blockchain transactions
- **Security Layer**: Advanced security protocols with quantum encryption, vault storage, and quarantine areas
- **Communication Layer**: Centralized communication center for inter-component data flow
- **AI Agents Layer**: Trading agents with different strategies for opportunity detection
- **Transformer Layer**: Market data and trading signal transformers for data analysis
- **Solana Integration Layer**: Connection, wallet management, and transaction interfaces
- **Storage Layer**: Secure, persistent data management with controlled access
- **API Layer**: RESTful and WebSocket interfaces for frontend interaction
- **Frontend Layer**: Interactive dashboard (WebAssembly) for monitoring and configuration

Each layer communicates through the Communication Center, with the Security Protocol enforcing access controls and data integrity between components.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Rust with Actix-Web framework
- **Blockchain**: Solana SDK for direct blockchain interaction
- **Frontend**: Rust (WASM) with Yew framework, compiled to WebAssembly
- **Data Processing**: Custom built quantum-inspired algorithms for market analysis
- **Security**: Advanced cryptographic techniques for secure wallet management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ with Cargo
- Solana CLI tools
- Node.js (for frontend build tools)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `cargo build`
3. Set up environment variables (see `.env.example`)
4. Run the development server: `cargo run`

## Configuration

The system can be configured through environment variables:

- `SOLANA_RPC_ENDPOINT`: URL of the Solana RPC endpoint
- `HOST`: Host IP address (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `PORT`: Port to run the server on (default: 5000)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (default: info)
