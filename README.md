# Solana Quantum Trading System

A comprehensive Solana trading system powered by quantum-inspired transformers, custom AI agents, and a transaction engine to identify opportunities and execute trades on the Solana blockchain.

## System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture with quantum-inspired design:

### Core Components

1. **Transaction Engine**: The central component that executes strategies and transactions
2. **Security Protocol**: Quantum-inspired security layer for data protection
3. **Communication Center**: Central hub for system-wide messaging
4. **Solana Connection**: Interface with the Solana blockchain
5. **Wallet Manager**: Handles Solana wallet operations
6. **Storage System**: In-memory storage for system data

### Specialized Transformers

1. **Micro QHC Transformer**: Quantum Hash Computing for pattern recognition
   - Utilizes quantum-inspired algorithms for ultra-fast pattern recognition
   - Simulates quantum state to recognize market patterns
   - Processes market data with quantum features

2. **MEME Cortex Transformer**: Specialized analyzer for meme tokens
   - Correlates social sentiment with price action
   - Tracks meme token volatility and momentum
   - Generates signals based on combined social and price data

3. **Communication Transformer**: Data organization layer
   - Routes data between system components
   - Enforces access control between layers
   - Handles system message processing

## Key Features

- **Pure Rust Implementation**: The entire system is implemented in Rust
- **Quantum-Inspired Security**: Advanced security protocols for data protection
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between system components
- **Real-Time Signal Processing**: Fast analysis of market data
- **WebAssembly Frontend**: Rust-compiled frontend for consistent code base

## Running the System
